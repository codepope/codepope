### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- :office: I'm architecting information at EnterpriseDB and living the SQL life

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
  blogs, apps and lots of weekend making.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  Swift, Deno/Typescript, always Go, always something else :)

- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
   I have too many devices and too little time which I share at Makeroni.cc, an online (on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYYXHSu)) popup makerspace which happens on the 1st and 3rd Sunday of each month in meatspace. Come along and make something with us.
